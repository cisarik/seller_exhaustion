└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. GA RUNS (with Coach-compatible config)
   ├─ evolution_step() with OptimizationConfig
   ├─ Supports soft penalties + curriculum learning
   ├─ Tracks diversity, stagnation, below_min_trades%
   └─ Records detailed metrics in history

2. BUILD EVOLUTION STATE
   ├─ Extract population stats
   ├─ Calculate fitness distribution
   ├─ Detect stagnation/diversity issues
   └─ Format as EvolutionState JSON

3. SEND TO GEMMA 3 COACH
   ├─ Connect to LM Studio (localhost:1234)
   ├─ Send: evolution state + system prompt
   ├─ Gemma analyzes: logs → diagnosis → recommendations
   └─ Return: JSON CoachAnalysis

4. PARSE & APPLY AUTOMATICALLY
   ├─ Extract JSON from Gemma response
   ├─ Parse into CoachRecommendation objects
   ├─ Apply to FitnessConfig + OptimizationConfig
   ├─ Update GA state
   └─ NO USER BUTTON - fully automatic!

5. NEXT GENERATION USES OPTIMIZED CONFIG
   ├─ Soft penalties restore fitness gradient
   ├─ Curriculum gradually increases requirements
   ├─ Immigrants maintain diversity
   ├─ Bounds overrides focus search
   └─ GA converges faster with Coach guidance

## What Coach Can Do

Coach can **autonomously adjust** any of these parameters:

### Fitness Function (8 parameters)
```python
# Switch between strategies
fitness_function_type = "hard_gates" | "soft_penalties"

# Adjust soft penalty strength
penalty_trades_strength = 0.5-1.0
penalty_wr_strength = 0.5-1.0

# Lower/raise requirements
min_trades = 5-20
min_win_rate = 0.3-0.6

# Enable curriculum learning
curriculum_enabled = True|False
curriculum_start_min_trades = 5
curriculum_increase_per_gen = 2
```

### GA Hyperparameters (6 parameters)
```python
tournament_size = 2-8           # Selection pressure
elite_fraction = 0.05-0.25      # Elitism
mutation_probability = 0.5-0.9  # Offspring mutation rate
mutation_rate = 0.1-0.7         # Mutation strength
sigma = 0.08-0.2                # Mutation scale
```

### Diversity Mechanisms (4 parameters)
```python
immigrant_fraction = 0.0-0.3    # % new random per gen
stagnation_threshold = 3-10     # Gens before immigrant trigger
stagnation_fitness_tolerance = 0.001-0.1
immigrant_strategy = "worst_replacement" | "random"
```

### Parameter Bounds
```python
override_bounds = {
    "ema_fast": (50, 240),
    "vol_z": (1.2, 1.6),
    # ... expand/narrow any search space
}
```

## Key Features

### ✅ Soft Penalty Fitness Function
**Problem**: Hard gates (-100 clipping) kill GA gradient  
**Solution**: Continuous penalty that maintains gradient  
**Result**: GA can distinguish improvements even below minimum requirements

Example:
```
Old (hard gates):
  11 trades → fitness = -100 (hard fail)
  10 trades → fitness = -100 (hard fail)
  → No difference! GA sees random noise

New (soft penalties):
  11 trades → fitness = 0.4 - 0.3*penalty = 0.3
  10 trades → fitness = 0.4 - 0.4*penalty = 0.2
  → Clear gradient! GA improves toward goal
```

### ✅ Curriculum Learning
**Problem**: Harsh minimum requirements prevent initial exploration  
**Solution**: Start low, gradually increase per generation  
**Result**: Population evolves smoothly toward goal

Example:
```
Gen 0-5:   min_trades = 5   (easy gate, explore freely)
Gen 6-10:  min_trades = 7   (tighten slightly)
Gen 11-15: min_trades = 9   (tighten more)
Gen 20+:   min_trades = 20  (reach target)
```

### ✅ Random Immigrants
**Problem**: Population converges prematurely, loses diversity  
**Solution**: Inject N% random individuals each generation  
**Result**: GA maintains exploration capability

Example:
```
Gen 5: diversity = 0.42 (low)
       → Coach: "add 15% immigrants"
Gen 6: 8 new random individuals replace worst
       → diversity increases → exploration resumes
```

### ✅ Dynamic Bounds Override
**Problem**: Fixed search space may be too wide or too narrow  
**Solution**: Coach can recommend expanding/narrowing specific parameters  
**Result**: GA focuses on promising regions of parameter space

Example:
```
Coach detects: ema_fast population clustered at boundary
Recommendation: expand bounds from [48, 192] → [40, 250]
Result: GA explores wider range, finds better solutions
```

### ✅ Stagnation Detection
**Problem**: When GA gets stuck, user doesn't know why  
**Solution**: Coach detects flat fitness for N generations  
**Result**: Coach automatically recommends diversity boost or other fixes

### ✅ Metrics Tracking
Coach monitors:
- Population diversity (0.0-1.0)
- Percentage below minimum requirements
- Stagnation (flat fitness for N gens)
- Recent fitness improvement
- Mean trade count vs requirement

## Example Recommendation Flow

### Gen 5: Coach Detects Problem
```
Input Log:
  Population size: 56
  Mean fitness: -15.2 ± 35.4
  Best fitness: 0.6
  Below min_trades: 57.1%
  Diversity: 0.42 (low)
  Stagnation: True (5 gens flat)
```

### Coach Analysis (Gemma 3)
```json
{
  "summary": "Hard gates cause -100 clipping for 57% of population, eliminating evolution gradient. Stagnation detected.",
  "recommendations": [
    {"parameter": "fitness_function_type", "current": "hard_gates", "suggested": "soft_penalties", "confidence": 0.95},
    {"parameter": "min_trades", "current": 10, "suggested": 5, "confidence": 0.90},
    {"parameter": "curriculum_enabled", "current": false, "suggested": true, "confidence": 0.85},
    {"parameter": "immigrant_fraction", "current": 0.0, "suggested": 0.15, "confidence": 0.80}
  ],
  "next_steps": [
    "Switch to soft penalties to restore fitness gradient",
    "Enable curriculum to gradually increase requirements",
    "Add immigrants to rebuild diversity"
  ]
}
```

### Automatic Application
```python
# Coach recommendations automatically applied:
fitness_cfg.fitness_function_type = "soft_penalties"  # 95% confident
fitness_cfg.min_trades = 5                            # 90% confident
fitness_cfg.curriculum_enabled = True                 # 85% confident
ga_cfg.immigrant_fraction = 0.15                      # 80% confident
```

### Results (Gen 6-15)
```
Gen 6: Soft penalties active → fitness gradient restored
       → Better individuals rank higher
       → GA selection improves

Gen 7-10: Curriculum ramps min_trades: 5→7→9→11
          → Population gradually trained upward
          → 30%→40%→50%→65% pass requirement

Gen 8-15: Immigrants maintain diversity → exploration continues
          → New parameter combinations tested
          → Best fitness improves from 0.6→0.8→1.1

Result: Autonomous GA tuning eliminated stagnation! 🎉

## System Design Principles

### 1. **Coach is Autonomous**
- No user buttons to press
- Recommendations flow automatically into next generation
- User just runs GA, Coach adapts configuration

### 2. **Coach is Interpretable**
- Every recommendation includes:
  - Current value
  - Suggested value
  - Reasoning (why)
  - Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- User can see Coach's logic

### 3. **Protocol is Strict**
- JSON schema for all Coach responses
- Named categories for all recommendations
- Clear parameter naming (no ambiguity)
- Gemma follows system prompt exactly

### 4. **GA is Coach-Compatible**
- All tunable parameters exposed in OptimizationConfig
- evolution_step() accepts Coach-modified config
- Backward compatible with old parameter names
- New features (soft penalties, curriculum) integrated smoothly

### 5. **Everything is Logged**
- Detailed metrics recorded each generation
- Coach analysis stored for review
- Recommendations tracked (which applied, which ignored)
- Full audit trail for research/debugging

## Integration Checklist

To integrate Evolution Coach into your UI:

- [ ] Ensure `OptimizationConfig` is passed to evolution_step()
- [ ] Enable diversity/stagnation tracking in ga_config
- [ ] Add "Analyze with Coach" button to stats_panel
- [ ] Call `get_coach_analysis()` when user clicks
- [ ] Auto-apply recommendations via `apply_coach_recommendations()`
- [ ] Update GA config objects in-place
- [ ] Continue evolution with new config
- [ ] Repeat every N generations

## Performance

**Coach Latency:**
- Build evolution state: ~10ms
- Send to Gemma 3: ~5-15s (depends on response)
- Parse & apply: ~50ms
- **Total: ~5-15 seconds** per analysis

**Recommendation Overhead:**
- 0% during evolution (Coach runs in background)
- Optional: trigger every 5 gens (minimal impact)
