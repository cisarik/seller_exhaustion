# Evolution Coach Agent - UI Integration Complete

## Summary

Successfully wired the Evolution Coach Agent into the UI optimization loop. The agent now automatically analyzes the population and takes corrective actions at configured intervals (e.g., every 10 generations).

## Changes Made

### 1. Settings Dialog - Agent Configuration (`app/widgets/settings_dialog.py`)

**Added Controls:**
- **Agent Max Iterations** spinner (1-20, default 10)
  - Controls how many tool calls the agent can make per session
  - Tooltip explains typical usage: 5-7 tool calls in 3-5 iterations

**Updated Controls:**
- **System Prompt** dropdown now includes "🤖 Agent Mode (agent01)" as first option
- Updated tooltip to explain agent01 = full agent with tool-calling capabilities

**Updated Info Text:**
```
💡 Evolution Coach Agent:
- AI agent using tool-calling LLM (Gemma 3 via LM Studio)
- Analyzes population state and diagnoses problems
- Takes direct actions: mutate individuals, adjust parameters, inject diversity
- Agent mode (agent01): Full autonomy with 27 tools available
- Analyzes every N generations (e.g., gen 10, 20, 30...)
- Typical session: 5-7 tool calls in 3-5 iterations (30-90 seconds)
```

**Settings Persistence:**
- Added `coach_agent_max_iterations` to save/load functions
- Reset defaults function now uses "agent01" prompt
- All settings saved to `.env` file

### 2. Coach Manager - Agent Method (`backtest/coach_manager_blocking.py`)

**Added Method: `analyze_and_apply_with_agent()`**

This method implements the full agent-based analysis workflow:

```python
async def analyze_and_apply_with_agent(
    self,
    population: Population,
    fitness_config: FitnessConfig,
    ga_config: OptimizationConfig,
    current_data=None  # Unused, kept for API compatibility
) -> Tuple[bool, Dict[str, Any]]
```

**Workflow:**
1. **FREEZE** population (create session snapshot)
2. **CREATE** toolkit and agent executor
3. **RUN** agent analysis (agent makes multiple tool calls)
4. **RETURN** to caller (GA resumes with modified population)

**Features:**
- Reads `coach_agent_max_iterations` from settings
- Creates `CoachToolkit` with full population access
- Creates `AgentExecutor` with LLM client
- Builds initial observation for agent
- Logs all agent actions to coach log
- Optionally reloads model to clear context
- Returns success status and action summary

### 3. Stats Panel - Coach Integration (`app/widgets/stats_panel.py`)

**Added Coach Check in `_update_after_generation()`:**

After each optimization step completes:

1. **Check** if coach should analyze this generation
2. **Extract** current configs (fitness, GA parameters)
3. **Run** agent analysis in background thread (non-blocking)
4. **Update** status bar with coach results

**Implementation Details:**
- Coach check runs in main thread (fast check)
- Agent analysis runs in background thread (doesn't block UI)
- Creates new asyncio event loop for async coach methods
- Extracts GA config from optimizer population
- Updates status bar with action count on success
- Logs errors to logger and status bar

**Thread Safety:**
- Coach runs in daemon thread
- Status bar updates use callback
- UI continues to update during coach analysis

### 4. Configuration (`/.env.example`)

Already had `COACH_AGENT_MAX_ITERATIONS` parameter:
```bash
COACH_AGENT_MAX_ITERATIONS=5
```

Now fully integrated with UI controls.

## User Flow

### 1. Configure Agent

Open Settings → Evolution Coach tab:
- **System Prompt**: Select "🤖 Agent Mode (agent01)"
- **Analysis Interval**: Set to 10 (analyzes at gen 10, 20, 30...)
- **Agent Max Iterations**: Set to 10 (allows 10 tool calls)
- **Auto Reload Model**: Keep checked (clears context)
- Click **Save Settings**

### 2. Download Data

Settings → Chart Indicators tab (or wherever data download is):
- Select date range
- Click Download
- Wait for data to load

### 3. Initialize Optimization

Main window:
- Data should be loaded
- Parameters should be set
- Click **Initialize Population**

### 4. Run Optimization & Watch Agent

Main window:
- Click **Step** repeatedly OR **Finish** for multi-step
- At generation 10: Agent automatically triggers
- Coach Log window shows agent activity:
  ```
  [AGENT  ] 🤖 Starting agent-based analysis at Gen 10
  [AGENT  ] 🔧 Agent created with max_iterations=10
  [AGENT  ] 🚀 Running agent analysis...
  [AGENT  ] ✅ Agent completed: 5 iterations, 7 tool calls
  [AGENT  ] 📋 Actions taken: 5
  [AGENT  ]   1. analyze_population
  [AGENT  ]   2. update_fitness_gates
  [AGENT  ]   3. mutate_individual
  [AGENT  ]   4. update_ga_params
  [AGENT  ]   5. finish_analysis
  [AGENT  ] ✅ Agent workflow complete
  ```
- Status bar shows: "✅ Coach: 5 actions taken at gen 10"
- Optimization continues with modified population
- Agent analyzes again at gen 20, 30, etc.

## Expected Agent Behavior

### Typical Session (Gen 10)

**Scenario: Gate Crisis**
- Population: 12 individuals
- Problem: 100% below min_trades=20 gate
- Agent actions:
  1. `analyze_population()` - diagnose problem
  2. `update_fitness_gates(min_trades=5)` - lower gate for quick relief
  3. `update_ga_params(immigrant_fraction=0.15)` - inject diversity
  4. `mutate_individual(#9, vol_z, 1.5)` - test lower selectivity
  5. `finish_analysis()` - complete

**Result:**
- Min trades gate lowered from 20 → 5
- 55% individuals now pass gate (was 0%)
- Diversity increased
- Exploration resumes

### Typical Session (Gen 20)

**Scenario: Premature Convergence**
- Population: 12 individuals
- Problem: diversity=0.08 (very low), no improvement
- Agent actions:
  1. `analyze_population()` - diagnose
  2. `get_param_distribution("vol_z")` - investigate clustering
  3. `update_ga_params(mutation_rate=0.7, immigrant_fraction=0.3)` - aggressive diversity injection
  4. `insert_individual(strategy="random")` - add explorer
  5. `insert_individual(strategy="random")` - add another
  6. `finish_analysis()` - complete

**Result:**
- Mutation rate increased 0.55 → 0.7
- Immigrant fraction 0.0 → 0.3
- 2 random individuals added
- Diversity will increase next generation

```
[AGENT  ] 🤖 Starting agent-based analysis at Gen 10
[AGENT  ] 🔧 Agent created with max_iterations=10
[AGENT  ] 🚀 Running agent analysis...
[AGENT  ] ✅ Agent completed: 5 iterations, 7 tool calls
[AGENT  ] 📋 Actions taken: 5
[AGENT  ]   1. analyze_population

```

### Terminal/Main Logger

Shows detailed debug info:
```
INFO: 🤖 Evolution Coach Agent triggering at generation 10
INFO: ✅ Coach agent completed: {'total_actions': 5, 'iterations': 5, 'tool_calls': 7}
```

### Debug Log Window

Shows technical details when `COACH_DEBUG_PAYLOADS=True`:
```
✓ 🔌 LM Studio agent client initialized
🧪 Coach payload size=12534 chars
🧪 Coach analysis JSON size=8923 chars
```

## Configuration Parameters

From `.env` file:

```bash
# Evolution Coach Agent Settings
COACH_MODEL=google/gemma-3-12b           # LLM model
COACH_SYSTEM_PROMPT=agent01              # Use agent mode
COACH_PROMPT_VERSION=agent01             # Agent prompt version
COACH_ANALYSIS_INTERVAL=10               # Analyze every 10 gens
COACH_AGENT_MAX_ITERATIONS=10            # Max tool calls per session
COACH_AUTO_RELOAD_MODEL=True             # Clear context after analysis
COACH_CONTEXT_LENGTH=5000                # Model context window
COACH_GPU=0.6                            # GPU offload ratio
COACH_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT=3600              # LLM timeout (1 hour)
COACH_DEBUG_PAYLOADS=False               # Enable detailed logging
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Triggering

**Check:**
1. Is coach_manager initialized? (should see startup log)
2. Is analysis interval correct? (default 10)
3. Are you at the right generation? (10, 20, 30...)

**Fix:**
- Check terminal logs for coach initialization
- Verify Settings → Evolution Coach → Analysis Interval

### Agent Timeout

**Symptoms:**
```
[AGENT  ] ❌ Exception: Timeout waiting for LLM response
```

**Fix:**
- Increase `COACH_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT` in settings
- Check LM Studio is running: `lms ps`
- Try faster model: `lms load google/gemma-2-9b-it`

### No Actions Taken

**Symptoms:**
```
[AGENT  ] ⚠️  No actions logged
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. Agent couldn't diagnose any problems
2. LLM didn't call any tools
3. Agent hit max iterations before finishing

**Fix:**
- Enable debug logging: `COACH_DEBUG_PAYLOADS=True`
- Check coach log for agent reasoning
- Increase max iterations if needed

## Success Criteria

✅ Agent triggers at configured intervals (e.g., gen 10)
✅ Agent makes 5-7 tool calls per session
✅ Actions are logged in coach window
✅ Population is modified (gates, parameters, individuals)
✅ Evolution continues after agent completes
✅ Fitness improves within 3-5 generations after intervention
✅ Status bar shows action count
✅ No UI freezing during analysis

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Data**: Run full optimization with coach enabled
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track if agent interventions improve fitness
3. **Tune Agent**: Adjust max_iterations if sessions too short/long
4. **Add Metrics**: Track agent success rate, impact on fitness
5. **Playbook Learning**: Agent could learn which playbooks work best
