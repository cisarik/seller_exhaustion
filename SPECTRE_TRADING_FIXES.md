# Spectre Trading Integration - Issues & Fixes

## Summary of Fixes Applied

All issues encountered during Spectre trading integration have been **successfully resolved**.

---

## Issue #1: Fibonacci Target Injection ❌ → ✅

### Problem
```
⚠ [spectre_trading] Failed to inject Fibonacci target: unhashable type: 'DatetimeIndex'
```

### Root Cause
Attempted to inject pandas Series with DatetimeIndex as a `SeriesDataFactor` into Spectre FactorEngine. Spectre's factor engine couldn't serialize the DatetimeIndex for distributed computation.

### Solution
Replaced `inject_series_factor()` with `make_fib_lookup_dict()` that:
1. Pre-computes Fibonacci targets on CPU using `add_fib_levels_to_df()`
2. Creates a simple dict: `timestamp_str → target_price`
3. Passes dict to algorithm via class attribute: `SellerExhaustionAlg.fib_target_dict`
4. During rebalance callback, performs O(1) lookup: `self.fib_lookup[str(now)]`

### Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates serialization issues
- ✅ Fast lookups (hash-based, not factor evaluation)
- ✅ No external data factor needed
- ✅ Cleaner separation of concerns (CPU feature prep, Spectre trading simulation)

### Code Changes
**Before:**
```python
def inject_series_factor(engine, series, factor_name, asset):
    # Converts to MultiIndex, creates SeriesDataFactor
    # ❌ Fails with DatetimeIndex serialization error
```

**After:**
```python
def make_fib_lookup_dict(feats_df, fib_col="fib_0618"):
    lookup = {}
    for idx, val in feats_df[fib_col].items():
        ts_str = str(idx)
        lookup[ts_str] = float(val) if not pd.isna(val) else np.nan
    return lookup
```

## Issue #2: Missing tqdm Dependency ❌ → ✅

### Problem
```
✗ [spectre_trading] Spectre trading failed: No module named 'tqdm'
```

### Root Cause
Spectre's `trading.run_backtest()` uses `tqdm` for progress bars, but it wasn't in poetry.lock.

### Solution
```bash
poetry add tqdm
```

### Status
✅ tqdm 4.67.1 now in poetry.lock and dependencies installed

---

## Issue #3: Volume Column Type ❌ → ✅

### Problem
```
ValueError: tensor cannot be any type of int, recommended to use float32
```

### Root Cause
Volume column was int64 from numpy random int generator, but Spectre's tensor operations on GPU require float32 for all numeric columns.

### Solution
Convert volume to float when building Spectre DataFrame:
```python
base["volume"] = base["volume"].astype(float)
```

### Code Location
`backtest/spectre_trading.py` - `df_to_memory_loader()` function

---

## Issue #4: OHLCV Specification ❌ → ✅

### Problem
```
IndexError: tuple index out of range
# Spectre expected ohlcv[4] (volume) but got only 4 elements
```

### Root Cause
MemoryLoader was created with `ohlcv=('open', 'high', 'low', 'close')` (4 columns) but Spectre's internal code tried to access `ohlcv[4]` (volume).

### Solution
Include volume in the OHLCV tuple:
```python
loader = MemoryLoader(spectre_df, ohlcv=('open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume'))
```

---

## Issue #5: Algorithm Instance Retrieval ❌ → ✅

### Problem
```
AttributeError: type object 'SellerExhaustionAlg' has no attribute 'trades'
```

### Root Cause
After `trading.run_backtest(loader, algo, start, end)`, we had the class (`algo`) not the instance. Spectre instantiates the algorithm internally, so we couldn't access `instance.trades`.

### Solution
Used class variable + thread-local lock to store and retrieve the instance:

```python
class SellerExhaustionAlg(trading.CustomAlgorithm):
    _last_instance = None
    _instance_lock = threading.Lock()
    
    def initialize(self):
        # Store instance during initialization
        with SellerExhaustionAlg._instance_lock:
            SellerExhaustionAlg._last_instance = self
        # ... rest of initialization
```

Then retrieve after Spectre run:
```python
with SellerExhaustionAlg._instance_lock:
    instance = SellerExhaustionAlg._last_instance
    if instance is not None:
        trades_list = instance.trades
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Thread-safe (uses lock)
- ✅ Simple and reliable
- ✅ No API hacking needed
- ✅ Works with Spectre's instantiation model

---

## Issue #6: Date Range Handling ❌ → ✅

### Problem
```
ValueError: There is no data between start and end.
```

### Root Cause
Calculated warmup rows and tried to start backtest from a skipped date, causing Spectre event manager to find no data in the range.

### Solution
Use full date range - Spectre handles warmup internally:
```python
# Use full date range
start = date_index[0]
end = date_index[-1]

# (Don't skip warmup rows for start date calculation)
```

## Testing

### Quick Test
```bash
cd /home/agile/seller_exhaustion
poetry run python3 << 'EOF'
from backtest.spectre_trading import run_spectre_trading
from strategy.seller_exhaustion import SellerParams
from core.models import BacktestParams, Timeframe
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

dates = pd.date_range('2024-01-01', periods=2000, freq='15min', tz='UTC')
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'open': 0.5 + np.random.randn(2000) * 0.0003,
    'high': 0.51 + np.random.randn(2000) * 0.0005,
    'low': 0.49 + np.random.randn(2000) * 0.0005,
    'close': 0.5 + np.random.randn(2000) * 0.0003,
    'volume': np.random.randint(1000, 5000, 2000),
}, index=dates)

result = run_spectre_trading(df, SellerParams(), BacktestParams(), Timeframe.m15)
print(f"✓ Trades: {result['metrics']['n']}")
EOF
```
